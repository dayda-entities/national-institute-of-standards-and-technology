Data set from peer-reviewed publication:  A. J. Fleisher et al., Absolute 13C/12C Isotope Amount Ratio for Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite from Infrared Absorption Spectroscopy, Nature Physics.Measurements of isotope ratios are predominantly made with reference to standard specimens that have been characterized in the past. In the 1950s, the carbon isotope ratio was referenced to a belemnite sample collected by Heinz Lowenstam and Harold Urey in South Carolina?s Pee Dee region. Due to the exhaustion of the sample since then, reference materials that are traceable to the origin artefact are used to define the Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB) scale for stable carbon isotope analysis. However, these reference materials have also become exhausted or proven unstable over time, mirroring issues with the international prototype of the kilogram that led to a revised International System of Units. A campaign to elucidate the stable carbon isotope ratio of VPDB is underway, but independent measurement techniques are required to support it. Here we report an accurate value for the stable carbon isotope ratio inferred from infrared absorption spectroscopy, fulfilling the promise of this fundamentally accurate approach. Our results agree with a value recently derived from mass spectrometry, and therefore advance the prospects of SI-traceable isotope analysis. Further, our calibration-free method could improve mass balance calculations and enhance isotopic tracer studies in CO2 source apportionment.
