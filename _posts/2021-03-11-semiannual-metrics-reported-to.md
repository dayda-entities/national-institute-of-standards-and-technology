NIST collects and reports numerous metrics semiannually to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy to demonstrate implementation of the NIST Plan for Public Access. These metrics include: the number of NIST data management plans (internal and external); the number of datasets listed on data.gov and made public on NIST's website; datasets accessed through NIST's data discovery tool; publications available through PubMed Central (PMC) and govinfo; and publications accessed through PMC.
