This report describes the test equipment, process, analysis, and data file formats for the Numisheet 2020 tensile and tension/compression testing of the four materials associated with the Numisheet 2020 conference benchmarks. The four materials include two steel alloys, DP980 for Benchmark 1 and DP1180 for Benchmark 2, and two 6000 series aluminum alloys, AA6xxx-T4 for Benchmark 1 and AA6xxx-T81 for Benchmark 2, that will be referred to here as BM1-DP980, BM2-DP1180, BM1-6xxx-T4, and BM2-6xxx-T81, respectively. The testing reported here was requested by the Numisheet 2020 Benchmark Committee and was performed by the NIST Center for Automotive Lightweighting (NCAL) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, MD. The tests were performed at NCAL from October 2019 through January 2020.
