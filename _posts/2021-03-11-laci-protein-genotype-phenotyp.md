This data table contains the processed data for the LacI genotype-phenotype landscape, a quantitative measurement of the phenotype for approximately 60,000 variants of the E. coli LacI protein. The table includes, for example, the DNA barcode sequencing counts and the estimated fitness for each variant across 24 different chemical environments. It also includes the estimated dose-response curves for each variant under induction with IPTG.
