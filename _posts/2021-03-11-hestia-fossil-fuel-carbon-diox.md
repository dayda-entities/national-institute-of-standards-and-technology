Hestia Project quantifies, simulates and visualizes greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide emitted in urban regions.  Los Angeles basin activity is provided at the 1 km grid spatial resolution, and at temporal resolutions of hourly or annually.  Hestia-LA urban CO2 emissions inventory builds upon work conducted at the national scale (Vulcan Project) that includes various sectorial attributions.  Hestia's high spatial and temporal resolution datasets are currently available for 2010 to 2015, in UTC or local time.
