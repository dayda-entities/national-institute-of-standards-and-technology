Hestia Project quantifies, simulates and visualizes greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide emitted in urban regions.  Salt Lake City, Utah activity is provided at the county level (0.002 degree grid resolution), and at hourly and yearly time frames.  It builds upon work conducted at the national scale by the Vulcan Project. These high spatial and temporal resolution datasets are available for 2002, 2010, 2011, and 2012.
