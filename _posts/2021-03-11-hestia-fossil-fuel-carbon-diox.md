Hestia Project quantifies, simulates and visualizes greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide emitted in urban regions.  Indianapolis data is provided at the county level (200 m grid resolution), and at hourly and yearly time frames.  It builds upon work conducted at the national scale by the Vulcan Project. These high spatial and temporal resolution datasets are available from 2010 to 2015.
