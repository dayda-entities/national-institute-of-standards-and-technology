Results of single-cell and single-transcript measurements collected as part of the Bias and Resolvability Attribution using Split Samples (BRASS) study.  Each file is a list of fluorescence intensities per cell (or estimated RNA counts per cell), for each of 12 different methods, for 3 biological replicates.
