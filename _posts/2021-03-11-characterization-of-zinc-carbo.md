This dataset contains X-ray EDS (energy dispersive spectroscopy), FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy), and DART-MS (Direct analysis in real time mass spectrometry) data and analysis files that
can be used to reproduce the results from the paper:

Christine P. Romano, Thomas Lam, G. Asher Newsome, Joshua A. Taillon, Nicole C. Little, and Jia-sun Tsang. "Characterization of zinc carboxylates on an oil paint test panel," Studies in Conservation, (2019), available at https://doi.org/10.1080/00393630.2019.1666467

For a detailed description of the files contained within this dataset, please extract the "README.zip" file into the root of the dataset folder, and open the "README.html" that is placed in the root folder afterwards. This top-level file can be opened with any web browser, and contains links to all the README files in the folders within the dataset. Each of those files contains a more complete description of the data contained within.
