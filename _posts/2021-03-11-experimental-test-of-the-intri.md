We present the data supporting "Experimental test of the intrinsic dimensionality of Hounsfield unit measurements" (In preparation).  In this study, we passed 34 different substances in separate vials through a computed tomography (CT) scanner at 4 different voltages.  At each voltage, we obtained 1824 images (in DICOM format) depicting a sequence of slices through the vials.  All 7296 images are provided here.  In addition, we provide a table of the substances, their masses, and their positions in the sequence.This dataset deprecates the earlier release of this data (ark:/88434/mds019bfm9).  The image and substance table data are exactly the same; however, the image data has been re-arranged to make browsing and downloading more convenient.
