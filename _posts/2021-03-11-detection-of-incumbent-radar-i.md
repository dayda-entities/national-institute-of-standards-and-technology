This data is for ROC curve plots from the publication,  "Detection of Incumbent Radar in the 3.5 GHz CBRS Band", Raied Caromi, Michael Souryal, and Wen-Bin Yang, IEEE GlobalSIP, Nov. 2018, Anaheim, CA.
The ROC curves represent performance of  federal incumbent radar detection in the 3.5 GHz CBRS band using field-measured waveforms. The data is for the following figures:

Fig. 2: Measured signal as template; signal with added WGN, Fig. 3: Synthetic template; signal with added WGN, Fig. 4: Synthetic template; signal with LTE interference, Fig. 5: Synthetic template; signal with measured adjacent-band radar emissions.
